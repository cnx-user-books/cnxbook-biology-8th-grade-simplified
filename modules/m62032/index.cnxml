These are skeletal muscles which move the skeleton. But there are two other types of muscle in the body, with different jobs. Cardiac muscle, found in the heart, is involved in pumping blood through the circulatory system. Smooth muscle is involved in different uncontrolled movements, such as having oneâ€™s hair stand on end when cold or frightened, or moving food through the digestive system.</para></content>
